## Problem Statement

Owing to the fact that many people have started embracing safaris we lack a platform where they can share their experiences with others who might be into travel and safaris. Other social media are not customized for specific postings hence not specific for safari and travel experiences.Kenya is a country where in a few days holiday, you can enjoy a lot .The problem is that we although having many websites that offer different kind of services ,The customers are enjoying a lot but there is a platform to share their experiences and reviews about a specific place and services offered.
Tourism being one of the biggest revenue generators in Kenya in its so unfortunate that we don't have a place where people can socialize on matters travel and safaris.We only have websites of tour companies that only advocate for their businesses therefore making room for bias review of services and experience.
